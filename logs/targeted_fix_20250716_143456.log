[14:38:17] ‚ùå Failed to load RAG models: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 20.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 79.25 GiB of which 564.56 MiB is free. Process 107363 has 19.91 GiB memory in use. Process 107438 has 2.87 GiB memory in use. Process 544574 has 2.56 GiB memory in use. Process 600986 has 28.69 GiB memory in use. Process 1052789 has 8.83 GiB memory in use. Process 1053083 has 12.53 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 566.00 MiB memory in use. Process 1102763 has 2.60 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 146.10 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 5.90 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
